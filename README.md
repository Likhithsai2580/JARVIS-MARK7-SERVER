```python
from main import CodeBrew, CodeBrewConfig
from llm._llmserver import LLMServer, GPT35_TURBO

# Initialize
config = CodeBrewConfig(
    max_retries=3,
    keep_history=True,
    verbose=True
)
llm = LLMServer(model=GPT35_TURBO, server_url="your-server-url")

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# JARVIS Control Server Documentation

## Device Connection Process

1. Generate QR Code:
```http
GET /api/generate-connection-code
```

Response:
```json
{
    "qrCode": {
        "server": "wss://your-server.com",
        "token": "unique-secure-token",
        "timestamp": 1648372847000
    }
}
```

2. Scan QR Code with Android App
The Android app scans this QR code and establishes a WebSocket connection using the provided token.

3. Authenticate Connection:
```json
{
    "type": "authenticate",
    "token": "unique-secure-token"
}
```

4. Send Commands:
```json
{
    "type": "command",
    "token": "unique-secure-token",
    "command": "COMMAND_NAME",
    "params": {
        // command specific parameters
    }
}
```

## Security Notes
- QR codes are valid for 5 minutes only
- Each token is unique and can only be used by one device
- Tokens are invalidated after disconnection

## Examples

### Example 1: Launch YouTube
```json

    "targetDevice": "pixel_6_pro",
    "command": "LAUNCH_APP",
    "params": {
        "packageName": "com.google.android.youtube"
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Take Screenshot
```json
{
    "type": "command",
    "targetDevice": "pixel_6_pro",
    "command": "TAKE_SCREENSHOT",
    "params": {}
}
```

## Error Codes

- `DEVICE_NOT_FOUND`: Target device is not connected
- `INVALID_COMMAND`: Command not recognized
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: App doesn't have required permissions
- `EXECUTION_FAILED`: Command execution failed

## Notes

1. Some commands require specific Android permissions
2. Some operations may require root access on non-rooted devices
3. Device must be registered before receiving commands
4. WebSocket connection must be maintained for real-time command execution

## Testing

You can test commands using any WebSocket client:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app');

ws.onopen = () => {
    // Register device
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: "register",
        deviceId: "test_device"
    }));

    // Send test command
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: "command",
        targetDevice: "test_device",
        command: "TAKE_SCREENSHOT",
        params: {}
    }));
};
```

Now update the MainActivity to handle incoming commands:

```kotlin:app/src/main/java/com/example/jarvismk7/MainActivity.kt
// Add to class properties
private lateinit var commandExecutor: CommandExecutor

// In onCreate
commandExecutor = CommandExecutor(
    this,
    systemOperationsHandler,
    systemSettingsHandler,
    packageManagerHandler
)

webSocketClient.onMessageReceived = { message ->
    try {
        val json = JSONObject(message)
        val command = json.getString("command")
        val params = json.getJSONObject("params")
        commandExecutor.executeCommand(command, params)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("MainActivity", "Error executing command", e)
    }
}
```
